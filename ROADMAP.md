# Roadmap

* An online playground
* LLVM code generation (not just direct Javascript output)
* Better error messages
* Documentation
* Test framework
* Documentation generator
* A code formatter
* A macro system for metaprogramming though I'm unsure as to how this can be shoehorned into the OCR
specification (maybe I should get in touch to suggest some modifications to the "pseudocode" guide?)
* Some useful libraries (HTTP servers, GUI stuff, etc)
* Nicer error messages
* Automated programming language assignment assessment (using weird formal verification magic I know
nothing about)
* Plagiarism detection for programming languages
* Statistical analysis on class assignments (to find common bugs/errors)
* An online IDE
